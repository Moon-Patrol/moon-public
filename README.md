# moon-public
public repo for testing public repo things

## why?
so that i can see the webhook events github sends from a public repo.

### did you know?
free github plans can't have environments configured except on public repositories!

## Triggering events
the fake-deploy github-action should run when a PR is merged into prod. however 
data enrichment will need to run before the deployment shows up in multitudes.
